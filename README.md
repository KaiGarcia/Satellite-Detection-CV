## **Motivation**  
Cloudstone Innovations aims to improve satellite and airplane detection through telescope systems by enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms. Overcoming the technical challenges will increase detection reliability, even under difficult imaging conditions, contributing to better aerospace operations.

## **Problem Statement**  
1. **Low SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) Detection**:  
   - Satellite streaks are often close to the noise floor, making it challenging to detect faint objects consistently. Reliable detection under noisy conditions is critical.  

2. **Photometric Calibration Issues**:  
   - Determining accurate visual magnitudes for satellite streaks is difficult due to local variations within the image.  
   - Global calibration strategies fail, necessitating localized calibration at the “image chip” level around the object of interest.  

3. **Limited Access to Labeled Data**:  
   - There may be uncertainty about the availability of ground truth labeled data for training machine learning models. Solutions must consider both labeled and unlabeled scenarios to ensure adaptability.

## **Proposed Solution Options**  
### **1. Traditional Image Processing Techniques**  
- **Noise Filtering and Image Smoothing**:  
   - Use Gaussian blur or bilateral filters to suppress noise.  
   - Apply edge detection algorithms (e.g., Canny or Laplacian) to highlight streaks.  

- **Background Subtraction and Adaptive Thresholding**:  
   - Use adaptive thresholding to differentiate between noise and faint objects.  
   - Implement background subtraction to isolate satellite streaks effectively.  

- **Image Augmentation Techniques**:  
   - Use synthetic data generation by adding controlled noise or transformations to available images to mimic faint streak scenarios.

### **2. Deep Learning Solutions (If Labeled Data is Available)**  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:  
   - Train CNN models to detect and classify satellite streaks using labeled imagery, leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet.  

- **YOLO or Faster R-CNN for Object Detection**:  
   - Fine-tune object detection frameworks to recognize streaks under low-SNR conditions.  

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:  
   - Use GANs to generate synthetic labeled imagery, augmenting training datasets and addressing data scarcity.  

---

### **3. Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Approaches (If Labeled Data is Unavailable)**  
- **Self-Supervised Learning**:  
   - Train models using unlabeled data by predicting transformations (e.g., rotation, color inversion).  
   - Use contrastive learning techniques (like SimCLR) to learn useful features from unlabeled imagery.

- **Clustering and Anomaly Detection**:  
   - Implement clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to group similar objects or detect anomalies (satellite streaks) within noisy images.  

- **Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning**:  
   - Use pre-trained models on public datasets (e.g., astronomical datasets) and fine-tune them with any available data.

### **4. Photometric Calibration Strategies**  
- **Localized Calibration with Sliding Windows**:  
   - Use small, moving windows to dynamically adjust the brightness calibration around the streak.  

- **Cross-Referencing with Known Stellar Magnitudes**:  
   - Compare detected streaks with nearby stars for relative calibration.  

- **Adaptive Calibration Models**:  
   - Train machine learning models to adjust the calibration dynamically based on local image characteristics.

## **Conclusion and Expected Outcomes**  
This project aims to enhance Cloudstone Innovations’ ability to detect and calibrate faint objects, such as satellites and airplanes, in telescope imagery. The solution will explore both traditional and deep learning-based techniques while remaining flexible to accommodate the availability (or lack) of labeled data. The outcomes will contribute to more reliable detection and accurate photometric measurements, benefiting aerospace operations.
